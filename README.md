rick_db is a simple SQL database layer for Python3. It includes connection management, Object Mapper, Query Builder,
and a Repository pattern implementation. It is **not** an ORM, and it's not meant to replace one. 

## Features
- Object Mapper;
- Fluent Sql Query builder;
- High level connectors for PostgreSQL, SqlLite3;
- Pluggable SQL query profiler; 
- Simple migration manager for SQL files;

> Note: SQLite may have different behaviour based on Python versions; notably, DDL statements in a transaction 
> may not be affected by rollback on Python <3.12. Also, there are limitations on text search when using the Grid helper

> Note: rick_db version >=2.0.0 **are not** backwards compatible with 1.x versions; Code changes are
> required to migrate between versions; see the documentation for further details

## Usage scenarios

rick_db was built to cater to a schema-first approach: Database schema is built and managed directly with SQL DDL commands,
and the application layer has no responsibility on the structure of the database.


## Installation
```
$ pip3 install rick-db
```

## Documentation

Project documentation can be found on the [Documentation](https://oddbit-project.github.io/rick_db/) website.

## TL;DR; example

Showcasing the Connection, DTO, Repository and Query Builder objects: 

```python
from rick_db import fieldmapper, Repository
from rick_db.backend.pg import PgConnectionPool
from rick_db.sql import Select, Literal


@fieldmapper(tablename='publisher', pk='id_publisher')
class Publisher:
    id = 'id_publisher'
    name = 'name'


@fieldmapper(tablename='book', pk='id_book')

    id = 'id_book'

              format(firstname=author.first_name, lastname=author.last_name, rating=rating))

## Running tests

To run the tests, you should have both tox and tox-docker, as well as a local docker daemon. Make sure the current user has
access to the docker daemon.
```python
$ pip3 install -r requirements-dev.txt
$ tox 
```
